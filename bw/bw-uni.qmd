title: "Univariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")
```


```{r}
#| fig-alt: "A count of the heights of various peaks, ranging from an elevation of 3800 feet to 7500 feet. A majoity of the peaks rang fron 400- 5000 feet, with 5 peaks at 4900 feet."
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white",fill = "pink", binwidth = 50) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of Hikes", title = "Hights of Peaks") +
  theme_minimal()
  
```
